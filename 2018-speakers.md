</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">I fall down rabbit holes often, as I was falling down one particular rabbit hole, one very easy and well known hack to get into Windows OS (any of them), made me tumble down the security layers in place to prevent this, I soon discovered every layer can essentially be hacked/cracked and rendered TPM/Bitlocker mechanism used to secure laptops relatively useless. This is of course a scoped target/attack, but aren't they all?</p>

    <h5 class="speaker">Brandon Enright</h5>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard that blockchains are the solution.  Have a problem (ANY problem) in need of a solution?  Blockchain it!  Of course, the hype doesn't match reality.  This talk will cover basic blockchain algorithm concepts, explain what sort of problems are particularly well suited to blockchains, and talk a bit about why infosec doesn't have those problems.</p>
    <p class="bio">Like all great cyber security thought leaders, Brandon Enright is a self-aggrandizing Twitter whore.  When he isn't leading cyber infosec thoughts, he's leading cyber dreams.  Brandon can factor large primes with nothing more than pencil and paper and even recite the digits of Pi in random order in arbitrary bases.  Recognized as one of the great legends in machine learning, several of Brandon's machines have learned so much that philosophers argue turning them off would be murder. Rumor has it that shortly after Elon Musk met Brandon, Elon bought a small island in the south pacific for shelter and revised his estimate of the coming singularity up a decade.  Brandon is why Bruce Schneier has trouble sleeping at night.</p>

    <h4 class="title">DevSecOps - Integrating Security in the Development Pipeline</h4>
    <h5 class="speaker">Magno Logan</h5>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Security Testing, when performed, is usually done at the end of the application development cycle, increasing the risk of delays and cost increase in the project if problems or errors are found. It is possible to overcome, or at least minimize, this problem by using the “Shift Security Left” (SSL) approach, by introducing security checks and validations in the software development lifecycle and performing automated security testing within the project pipeline. This talk aims to demonstrate some ways on how to implement the SSL approach in your development lifecycle and what tools can be used to automate security testing and vulnerability management by performing multiple checks and validations throughout the application development process.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Mark turns his obsession with secure bootstraps towards a progress update on the work of others to re-bootstrap the free world (bootstrappable.org) . Along the way he'll review the role bootstrapping could play for the problem of 2 or more persons in a room needing to trust a shared computer. (As per last year, Mark calls this the voting machine problem or Wright-Andresen problem)</p>
    <p class="bio">Mark is an occasional free software hacker and member since founding of Winnipeg's hackerspace Skullspace.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a complex and highly versatile service that makes it useful for a wide variety of applications, from static website serving to backup and storage. These properties also make it notorious for being frequently misconfigured and poorly understood.

    <h5 class="speaker">Sarah LaCroix</h5>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">When people think “abuse”, most people are still thinking about throwing punches and name-calling. However, as the reliance on technology grows, so does the ability to use it to exert power over others. Technological abuse can be harder to identify because we’re not as familiar with it. This talk explores the different ways technological abuse may manifest itself and how we can empower people to leave a relationship, avoid future abusive relationships and help others to do the same.</p>
    <p class="bio">Sarah LaCroix cares about technology, education and empowerment.

    <p class="abstract">For large organizations, it can be hard to minimize your digital footprint. Whether it be mergers and acquisitions, spun up cloud environments, or any other assets forgotten/not properly decommissioned over the years, it can be a challenge to put together a comprehensive and accurate inventory. This talk will go over a number of publicly available datasets that one can use to view what everyone else on the internet can find out about your digital footprint and passively monitor for changes.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Regular, enforced password rotation has been a part of the generally accepted best security practices for decades. However, password rotation not only provides no benefit to security, it can actually make an organization less secure. In this talk, I am going to explain why mandatory password rotation should join other, backward practices like bloodletting and asbestos insulation on the trash heap of history.</p>
    <p class="bio">Travis misspent 10 years studying computers and network security at the University of Manitoba before being unleashed on an unsuspecting world.
