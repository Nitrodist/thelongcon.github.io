    <h4>Security BSides</h4>
    <p>Security BSides is a global, non-profit organization that exists to facilitate the creation of local information security conferences. These conferences are ideally organized by locals, and feature local presenters. Unlike other conferences, BSides events are low-cost, relaxed, and inclusive and attempt to encourage interaction amongst organizers, speakers, and attendees.</p>

    <h4>BSides Winnipeg</h4>
    <p>BSides Winnipeg is one of the many local BSides events found around the world. It was first held in 2013, where speakers presented to a sold-out venue over the course of a weekend. Second and third events were held in 2015 and 2017, both selling out as well. All presentations from previous years can be found in our archive.</p>

    <h4>Participating</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions about how to participate in the event, either as a <a href="/speakers/">speaker</a> or a <a href="/sponsors/">sponsor</a>, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

    <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
    <p>We have no tolerance for physical/verbal/sexual harassment!</p>

    <p>Asking questions of a speaker during their talk, to get clarity or debate a point is not harassment &ndash; heckling or haranguing the speaker is. If you are not sure, ask, or err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. If what they are doing would not be acceptable to have done to you, your best friend, your worst enemy, your sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother, father, or any human being, do not let them treat anyone else that way &ndash; whether you know them or not. If someone asks you to stop &ndash; stop.</p>

    <p>If you are having an issue with a BSides Winnipeg participant of any badge type, find a member of our Safety &amp; Security Team in the red BSides t-shirts (or any staff member). They will call our Harassment Response Team, who will take an official incident report and determine next steps.</p>

    <p>For other non-conference related harassment concerns, e-mail <a href="mailto:organizers@bsideswpg">organizers@bsideswpg.ca</a> for assistance.</p>

    <p>Policy graciously borrowed from BSidesSF, with minor alterations.</p>
